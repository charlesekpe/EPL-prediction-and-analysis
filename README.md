As a huge football fan, this model was exciting to build.
It takes account of a Premier League teams stats before a match:
1. Shots
2. Shots on target
3. Goals conceded
4. Corners
5. Form
6. Points accumulated during the season

Of course, predicting a match requires more stats like transfers, injuries, individual players and much more.
But the model utilizes the available stats well and can achieve an accuracy of over 61%
